1. This game has now become fully interactable with a character 
that walks around the screen. At the top you will se an Ore-count.
Once You reach 5 Ore you can shoot using the CONTROL KEY. 
The fire will shoot in the last direction you were facing.

2. When you trigger the event, a fire animation will come out of the
character. It will be in the direction he was last facing.

3. Several Things will happen. First, The fire animation is triggered. 
Second, The background will be changed to a different color grass.
Third, if a miner is in the way of the fire, it will turn into
a miner that is on fire.  He will run fast to the nearest water around.
If any other entity is in the way of the fire, the entity will be removed
from the world.

4. The new entity is both the character and the miner on fire.

*COOL NOTE: We changed the way the world is built.  It reads a PNG file
and evaluates the RGB value of each pixel.  Then depending on that
RGB value, then it will create an entity specific to that RGB value.
This makes it a lot easier to create/design worlds, and adds a really
cool feature.
